        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2> 
        <p>
          A README file is the first place someone looks to understand your project. It explains what the project does, how to install and run it, and any important details a user or contributor needs to know. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          A clear README saves time, reduces confusion, and makes your work more welcoming to others.

          <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2> 
        <p> 
          A wireframe is a simple visual plan of a webpage or app. It focuses on layout, structure, and content placement rather than colours or final design details.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Wireframes help you think about user experience early, spot problems before you code, and communicate ideas clearly with others.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2> 
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development. It lets you work on new features or fixes without changing the main codebase until you are ready.
        </p> 
        <p>
          By using branches, you can experiment safely, review changes, and then merge them back into the main branch when they are tested and stable.
